        <p>Since I have met you my life has become a lot more joyful. I love waking up in the mornings, hearing about your dreams, talking to you and starting my day with a smile. I love how we can talk for a long time all throughout the day and not feel like we should stop. I love our evenings and nights that we spend together talking, playing games, sharing memes or being naughty naughty &#128520; It's sad when we have to go to sleep, but I can look forward to waking up in the morning and talking to you again. You have become my favorite person to talk to and spend time with and I'm really thankful that I have gotten the opportunity to meet you and get to know you. A lot of different small things had to  happen for us to meet and they all did and I'm thankful for them happening. I look forward to all our future talks, getting to know you even more and spending more time with you. While we can't meet irl right now, I look forward to the day we will meet! </p>
